<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><i>Coordination Artifacts</i> are designed to separate out an abstract
communication pattern, on the one hand, and the domain-specific
clients of the communication on the other. A generic or abstract
Artifact is concerned with organizing Communities, Relays and other
COUGAAR infrastructure in a structured way in order to represent a
pattern of inter-Agent chatter.  A specific Artifact completes a
generic artifact by supplying Community names, data types etc.

<p> An Artifact includes a set of <i>Roles</i> that define the
functions performed by each client.  For example in an Artifact that
implements a multicast request (one request, multiple replies), the
two Roles are queryer and responder.  Every Role has a corresponding
interface that specifies the operations that can be performed on the
Artifact by clients playing that Role.   These interfaces are
therefore very much like <i>Facets</i> in the CORBA Component Model:
they present a specific viewport into the Artifact as a whole.  The
Artifact itself can then be thought of as a provider of Facets.

<p>  This leads to the following Java interfaces:

<ul>

 <li><strong>RolePlayer</strong>: From the Artifact's perspective, each
     client plays one of the Artifacts defined roles.  This interface
     specifies that abstracion.</li>

 <li><strong>Facet</strong>: The generic viewport that RolePlayers
     have into the Artifact is specified by this interface.  For
     particular roles, this interface might be extended.
 </li>

 <li><strong>FacetProvider</strong>:  The provision of Facets to
     RolePlayers is described by this interface.</li>

 <li><strong>FacetBroker</strong>: This interface defines a COUGAAR
     service that provides the top-level entry point into CAs: the
     methods that allow FacetProviders and RolePlayer to be linked
     together.</li>

</ul>

<p> In the current design, the assumption is that RolePlayers and
Facets communicate through a shared fact base, eventually including
Jess-like rules defined in terms of facts.  For now
<strong>Fact</strong> is defined locally, and Fact instances are
handled through ordinary method calls between Facets and RolePlayers.

<p>More detailed descriptions of these classes and interfaces follow.
