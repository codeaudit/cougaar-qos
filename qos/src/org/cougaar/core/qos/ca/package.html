<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><i>Coordination Artifacts</i> are designed to separate out an
  abstract communication pattern, on the one hand, and the
  domain-specific clients of the communication on the other. The
  internal parts of the Artifact are concerned with organizing
  Communities, Relays and other COUGAAR infrastructure in a structured
  way in order to represent a pattern of inter-Agent chatter.  Each
  kind of Artifact completes this by supplying Community names, data
  types etc.

<p> A CoordinationArtifactTemplate defines a set of <i>Roles</i> that
  define the functions performed by each client.  For example in
  Artifacts that implement a multicast request (one request, multiple
  replies), the two Roles are queryer and responder.  Every Role has a
  corresponding interface that specifies the operations that can be
  performed on the Artifact by clients playing that Role.  These
  interfaces are therefore very much like <i>Facets</i> in the CORBA
  Component Model: they present a Role-specific viewport into the
  Artifact as a whole.  An Artifact also defines a set of parameters
  that, for kind of Artifact, distinguish the individuals of that kind
  from one another.

<p>An instance of a CoordinationArtifactTemplate is something like a
  Java class: it defines a <i>kind</i> of Artifact, in terms of its
  Facets and parameters, and it has the responsibiliy for creating
  individual CoordinationArtifacts of that kind, each of which has its
  own state.  These stateful parameterizations are mainly concerned
  with creating Facets for each Role and matching them to clients. 
  


<p>  This leads to the following Java interfaces:

<ul>

 <li><strong>RolePlayer</strong>: From the Artifact's perspective, each
     client plays one of the Artifact's defined roles.  This interface
     specifies that abstracion.</li>

 <li><strong>Facet</strong>: The generic viewport that any given
     RolePlayer has into the Artifact is specified by a Facet, which
     is effectively a definition of the role.
 </li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifact</strong>: The creation of Facets and
     the linkage between Facets RolePlayers is handled at this layer.
     This is also the holder of state for a given instance of some
     Template</li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifactTemplate</strong>: An abstract
   specification of what Artifacts of this kind.  The main job of the
   Template is to define the logical Roles and parameters, and to
   create and manage CoordinationArtifacts as needed.
 </li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifactBroker</strong>: This interface
     defines a COUGAAR service that provides the top-level entry point
     into CAs.</li>

</ul>


<p>More detailed descriptions of these classes and interfaces follow.
