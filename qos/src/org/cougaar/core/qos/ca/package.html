<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><i>Coordination Artifacts</i> are designed to separate out an
  abstract communication pattern, on the one hand, and the
  domain-specific clients of the communication on the other. The
  internal parts of the Artifact are concerned with organizing
  Communities, Relays and other COUGAAR infrastructure in a structured
  way in order to represent a pattern of inter-Agent chatter.  Each
  kind of Artifact completes this by supplying Community names, data
  types etc.

<p>Coordination Artifacts are created by a
  CoordinationArtifactProvider, via requests made to the
  CoordinationArtifactBroker.  A CoordinationArtifactProviders is like
  a COUGAAR ServiceProvider: its primary job is to find or make
  CoordinationArtifacts of some particular kind.  But it also
  implicitly defines a set of <i>Roles</i> that describe the functions
  performed by clients of this kind of Artifact.  For example in
  Artifacts that implement a multicast request (one request, multiple
  replies), the two Roles are queryer and responder.  

<p>Every Role has a corresponding interface that specifies the
  operations that can be performed on the Artifact by clients playing
  that Role.  These interfaces are therefore very much
  like <i>Facets</i> in the CORBA Component Model: they present a
  Role-specific viewport into the Artifact as a whole.  Likewise, the
  client's handle on a Facet is similar to a <i>Receptacle</i> in CCM.
  A Provider also defines a set of parameters that distinguish the
  individuals of that kind of Artifact.

  


<p>  This leads to the following Java interfaces:

<ul>

 <li><strong>RolePlayer</strong>: From the Artifact's perspective, each
     client plays one of the Artifact's defined roles.  This interface
     specifies that abstracion.</li>

 <li><strong>Facet</strong>: The generic viewport that any given
     RolePlayer has into the Artifact is specified by a Facet, which
     is effectively a definition of the role.
 </li>

 <li><strong>Receptacle</strong>: The RolePlayer's handle on a Facet.
 </li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifact</strong>: The creation of Facets and
     the linkage between Facets RolePlayers is handled at this
     layer.</li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifactProvider</strong>: The main job of
   the Provider is to define the logical Roles and parameters, and to
   create and manage CoordinationArtifacts as needed.
 </li>

 <li><strong>CoordinationArtifactBroker</strong>: This interface
     defines a COUGAAR service that provides the top-level entry point
     into CAs.</li>

</ul>
