The Gossip subsystem allows Metrics collected on one Node to be
disseminated to other Nodes in the society. The Metrics are transfered
by piggybacking Gossip objects as attributes of ordinary messages
being sent between Nodes. Gossip takes two forms: requests for Metrics
from a neighbor Node, and responses to those requests.
