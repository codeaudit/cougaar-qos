<h1>Frames and FrameSets</h1>

<p> <b>Frames</b> are a simple, lightweight form of knowledge
representation.  A <b>DataFrame</b> is a unit of knowledge, consisting
of a type specification (what kind of frame it is) and a set of
name-value pairs representing its current state.  The pairs, also
known as <b>slots</b>, can change dynamically at runtime.  The type of
any given DataFrame is fixed for the lifetime of the Frame.
DataFrames can be treated as beans, more or less, with the standard
form of accessor methods.  This allows DataFrames to be shadowed in
Jess, which in turn means that rules can use slot values of
DataFrames</p>

<p> A DataFrame can represent either an entity or a binary
relationship between other DataFrames.  In the latter case, each of
two parts of the binary relation are specified by a type/slot/value
triple which is expected to match at most one DataFrame (i.e., at most
one frame of the given type should have the given value in the given
slot).  </p>

<p> The meta-data in the Cougaar frame system is derived from
<b>prototypes</b> described in xml.  These prototypes correspond to
the types of the DataFrames, and are organized as a single-inheritance
hierarchy.  Prototypes include declarations of the slots they include,
with optional default values.  </p>

<p>Prototype meta-data is used for several purposes.  First, it's used
to generate Java classes for the types.  DataFrame instances at run
time will be instances of one of these generated classes.  In
addition, the prototypes are also accessible at runtime as frames
themselves, in particular as <b>PrototypeFrames</b>. </p>


<p>Frames are organized into <b>FrameSets</b>, which is simply an
organized collection of DataFrames and PrototypeFrames.  The latter
can come and go dynamically; the former are associated with the
FrameSet when it's made and are fixed for the life of the FrameSet
(the structure is fixed -- specific slot values in PrototypeFrames are
not).  The main job of a FrameSet is to provide a well-defined
subspace of Frames.  It's also used to cache interesting
relationships, including the relationship between a DataFrame and its
Prototype, as well as the <a href="#containment">containment</a>
relationshops.</p>

<p>FrameSets can be created and populated via xml using the
<b>FrameSetService</b>, and existing FrameSets can be found with that
service.  [more]  </p>

<p> <a name="containment"></a> One of the novel features of the
Cougaar frame system is that it supports two independent
hierarchies. In addition to the prototype hierarchy, the Cougaar frame
system a second single-inheritance hierarchy known as
<b>containment</b>. Containment is a special relationship used to
augment slot value lookup at runtime.  As one might expect, DataFrames
can include a frame-specific value for any given slot.  If it does, no
further work is required.  If it doesn't, the prototype hierarchy is
searched for a default value or for a path specification (see <a
href="#paths">below</a> for more on paths).  If this fails as well,
the containment hierarchy can then be searched.  This allows a
DataFrame to have virtual access to slots defined by its logical
container.  The containment relation is defined as part of FrameSet
and fixed when the FrameSet is created.  This relation is another
example of caching handled by the FrameSet. </p>


<a name="paths"></a> <p>Another novel features of the Cougaar frame
system is the <b>Path</b> specification.  The description of any given
slot in a prototype can indicate that the value of that slot for some
frame F is determined by following a particular path from F a runtime.
A Path represents a kind of encapsulated visitor pattern.  It consists
of an ordered series of <b>Forks</b> and a slot.  Each Fork refers to
a relation and a role.  This allows any given frame to follow a path,
one relationship at a time, to any related frame, arbitrarily far
away.  When the final frame in the path is reached, the given slot
value is returned as the value of the original slot referene.  <p>
