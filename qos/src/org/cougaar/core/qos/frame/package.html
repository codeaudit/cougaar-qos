<h1>Frames and FrameSets</h1>

<p> Frames are a simple, lightweight form of knowledge representation.
A DataFrame is a unit of knowledge, consisting of a type specification
(what kind of frame it is) and a set of name-value pairs representing
its current state.  The pairs, also know as slots, can change
dynamically at runtime.  The type of any given DataFrame is fixed for
the lifetime of the Frame.</p>

<p> A DataFrame can represent either an entity or a binary
relationship between other DataFrames.  In the latter case, each of
two parts of the binary relation are specified by a type/slot/value
triple which is expected to match at most one DataFrame (i.e., at most
one frame of the given type should have the given value in the given
slot).  </p>

<p> The meta-data in the Cougaar frame system is derived from
prototypes described in xml.  These prototypes correspond to the types
of the DataFrames, and are organized as a single-inheritance
hierarchy.  Prototypes include declarations of the slots they include,
with optional default values.  </p>

<p>Prototype meta-data is used for several purposes.  First, it's used
to generate Java classes for the types.  DataFrame instances at run
time will usually be instances of one of these generated classes.  In
addition, the prototypes are also accessible at runtime as frames
themselves, in particular as PrototypeFrames. </p>

<p> In addition to the prototype hierarchy, the Cougaar frame system a
second, independent hierarchy known as "containment".  See below for
more on this. Containment is a special relationship used to augment
slot value lookup at runtime.  As one might expect, DataFrames can
include a frame-specific value for any given slot.  If it does, no
further work is required.  If it doesn't, the prototype hierarchy is
searched for a default value or for a path specification (see below
for more on paths).  If this fails as well, the containment hierarchy
can then be searched.  This allows a DataFrame to have virtual access
to slots defined by its logical container.</p>

<p>Frames are organized into FrameSets, which is simply an organized
collection of DataFrames and PrototypeFrames.  The latter can come and
go dynamically; the former are associated with the FrameSet when it's
made and are fixed for the life of the FrameSet (the structure is
fixed -- specific slot values in PrototypeFrames are not).  Also fixed
at FrameSet creation time is the containment relationshiop -- the
particular relationship prototype use for the containment hierarchy.
</p>

<p>FrameSets can be created and populated via xml using the
FrameSetService. Existing FrameSets can be found with that service.
