This directory contains the "process_logs.plx" script, which reads
"*.log" and generates ".csv" and ".png" views of the profiling data.

NOTE:
This script worked once, but is very messy!  It generates
hundreds of csv/png files, of which only a small percentage may
be interesting!

Usage:

1)
Create your society config with the profiler enabled.
See the profile javadocs and example in
  configs/profile/ProfilePing.xml
For the scripts to work, you must set this system property on all
nodes:
  -Dorg.cougaar.core.logging.addAgentPrefix=false
and you must leave the profiling period at the default value of
60000 (once per minute).
      
2)
Run a profiled experiment, redirecting the stdout to
per-node logs, e.g.:
  `cougaar mySociety.xml MyNode > MyNode.log`

3)
Copy the logs to this directory, or fix all script
references to "./"   (i.e. `grep \\\.\/ *.sh *.plx`)

4)
Run `process_logs.plx`.  Most errors can be ignored.

5)
Look at the generated ".png" files.  Some that may be
interesting:

  # load average at each node:
  loadavg.png

  # agent messaging count throughput:
  msg_count_sent_agent_rate.png 

  # agent messaging byte throughput:
  msg_bytes_sent_agent_rate.png 

  # aggregate message count throughput:
  msg_count_sent_host_all.png 

  # cpu load in "jiffies"
  cpu_user_rate.png

  # network send rate
  network_eth0_sent_rate.png

  # blackboard "execute()" calls
  transactions_count_rate.png

6)
Run `./bb_pie_csv.plx count`.  This will print a CSV that
can be plotted as a pie chart of the blackboard contents.
