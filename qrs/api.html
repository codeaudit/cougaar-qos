<h1>Resource Status Service</h1>

<p>Dynamic adaptation to changes in resource availability in a
distributed system requires timely, accurate relatively high-level
integrated data.  This data generally has to be synthesized from a set
of simpler data of variable reliability and timeliness and must be
distributed in an efficient way.  The data synthesis can viewed as
form of data fusion, or in some cases, as a kind of impedance matcher.

<p>One way to envision such a service in the broad sense is as a
hierachical confederation of local services communicating among
themselves, each of which implements a particular Resource Model
describing the data being represented at that level.  Each such
service is locally responsible for handling raw sensor data as well as
requests for integrated data from consumers, where these consumers
might be well other service instances.

<p>Various aspects of the RSS are described in more detail below.  The
<i>DataValue</i> section describes the structure of data entering and
leaving the RSS.  The <i>DataFeed</i> section describes in an abstract
way the entities which provide raw low-level "sensor" data to the RSS.
The <i>ResourceStatusService</i> section describes the interface
exposed to the client.  The <i>RSS Data Models</i> section describes
the generic organization of the internal data structures and how they
model resource data. 


<ol>
  
<li>
    <b>DataValue</b>

    <p>The data entering and leaving an RSS needs a set of attributes
    associated with each value.  A minimal set of attributes would
    include the following dimensions (which, not coincidentally, are
    closely related to the familiar notions of timeliness, accuracy
    and precision).

    <ul>

      <li><b>Time</b>.  Since the utility of data tends to degrade over
      time, we need to know when it was collected and some measure of
      how its utility decays.  These are represented by the
      <code>timestamp</code> and <code>halflife</code> fields, below.
      In addition to being accessible to the ultimate consumer of the
      data, these fields are used internally by the RSS in its own
      management of timeliness and reliability.  </li>

      <li><b>Credibility</b>.  Data has varying levels of credibility
	  depending on how it was arrived at.  This can be captured
	  most easily as a real number between 0.0 (no credibility at
	  all) and 1.0 (no possibility of doubt).  This is represented
	  in the <code>credibility</code> field, below.  As with the
	  time related dimensions, credibility is accessible to the end
	  user of the data and is also used internally by the RSS in
	  its own management of reliability. </li>

      <li><b>Origin</b>.  Consumers of data might wish to know the
      source.  This is represented in the <code>provenance</code>
      field, as an uninterpreted string. </li>

      <li><b>Units</b>.  In order to interpret data sensibly,
      consumers need to know what unit any given value
      represents. This is represented in the <code>units</code>
      field, for now an uninterpreted string.

    </ul>

    <p> Given this, and assuming three kinds of raw data values
    (numeric, boolean, character), data in an RSS is represented as
    follows:

    <p>
    
    <pre><code>
    // Assume three sorts of values: strings, booleans and numbers.
    enum data_types { number_data, string_data, boolean_data};
    typedef union data_value_union switch(data_types) {
    case number_data:
	double  d_value;

    case string_data:
	string  s_value;

    case boolean_data:
	boolean    b_value;
    } data_value;



    struct DataValue {
	long long timestamp; // when was it gathered
	long long halflife;  // how long is it good for
	double credibility;  // how reliable is it
	string units;        // what is it measuring
	string provenance;   // where did it come from
	data_value value;    // the value itself
    }; 

    </code></pre>
    
</li>


<li>
    <b>DataFeed</b>

    <p>The RSS is a layered service, implemented by a hierarchy of RSS
    instances in which the higher level data representations are
    computed in part on the basis of data supplied by lower levels.
    This layering is parallel to the layering structure of the
    resource management as a whole.
    
    <p>For the most part this hierarchy can be implemented simply by
    making any given RSS instance a client of the other RSS instances
    on which it depends.  But eventually this chain of RSS instances
    linked to one another has to bottom out into a simpler kind of
    data provider, a <i>sensor</i>, which communicates with the RSS
    through a different conceptual interface.  This interface is what
    we call a DataFeed.  To some extent the DataFeed notion is an
    implementation detail, of no concern to RSS clients.  For
    completeness, it's described here briefly.

    <p>DataFeeds come in various flavors, each associated with a
    particular kind of sensor.  Some examples might include static
    configuration data (e.g., from XML files); network measurements
    (e.g., from Cisco routers); and host measurements (e.g,, from
    Eternal Systems monitors).

    <p>Sensors are assumed to be able to provide data to the RSS with
    a descriptive <i>key</i> indicating what the data represents and
    which particular sensor it came from.  The interpretation of the
    key is handled by the implementation of the specific DataFeed
    associated with that kind of sensor, and should provide enough
    information to allow the RSS instance to find the right higher
    level data abstractions that use the raw sensor data.  In other
    words, the interpretation of the keys is what makes possible the
    data dependency relationships within the RSS itself.

    <p>As an example, a host data key might look like this:
    <code>HOST_192.168.0.1_LOADAVERAGE_ETERNALSYS</code>, indicating
    that the corresponding data is a load average for the given host
    as supplied by one of Eternal's host monitors.

    <p>For reasons of efficiency, most DataFeeds are local to the RSS
    process.  But one special feed is accessible via CORBA.  This feed
    is used in the <code>pushString</code> and <code>pushInt</code>
    calls on the <code>ResourceStatusService</code> interface (see
    below).



</li>

<li>
    <b>ResourceStatusService</b>, <b>RSSSubscriber</b> and
    <b>Qualifiers</b>

    <p> The ResourceStatusService interface supports two styles of
    access, query and subscription.  The RSSSubscriber interface
    needs to be implemented by clients using the subscription style.
    The Qualifier interfaces allow subscription clients to restrict
    the callbacks they get.

    <pre><code>
   // Client Interfaces
   interface RSSSubscriber {
       void dataUpdate(in string callback_id, in DataValue data);
   };

   
    enum QualifierKind { min_delta, min_credibility }; // etc

    interface Qualifier {
	// no remote calls on this
    };


    // Common root for all factories
    interface QualifierFactory {
    };

    interface MinDeltaQualifierFactory : QualifierFactory {
	Qualifier getQualifier(in double threshold);
    };
	

    interface MinCredibilityQualifierFactory : QualifierFactory {
	Qualifier getQualifier(in double threshold);
    };
	

    interface ResourceStatusService {
	boolean query(in ResourceDescription resource, out DataValue result);

	boolean unqualifiedSubscribe(in RSSSubscriber listener,
				     in ResourceDescription resource,
				     in long callback_id);

	QualifierFactory getQualifierFactory(in QualifierKind kind);

	boolean qualifiedSubscribe(in RSSSubscriber listener, 
				   in ResourceDescription resource,
				   in long callback_id,
				   in Qualifier qualifier);

	void unsubscribe(in RSSSubscriber listener, 
			 in ResourceDescription path);

	boolean invoke(in ResourceDescription resource,
		       in string method_name,
		       in ParameterList args)
	    raises (NoSuchMethodException);

        void pushString(in string key, in string raw_value);

	void pushLong(in string key, in long raw_value);
    };


    </code></pre>

    <p>The primary invocation points for RSS clients are the
    <code>query</code> and <code>subscribe</code> methods of the
    <code>DataAccess</code> interface.  Both take a <i>path</i>
    argument, a string which describes the location of the desired
    value in the data-dependency space of an RSS.  For more details on
    paths, see the <a href="#DataModel">Data Model</a> section, below.
    As a simple example of a path, the point-to-point network capacity
    between two hosts might look like this: <code>
    "IpFlow(192.168.0.10, 192.168.1.100):Capacity"</code>.

    <p> The <code>query</code> call is used to fetch the current value
    described by the path.  The <code>subscribe</code> call is used to
    setup a notification for changes in the value described by the
    path: if that value changes and if the change meets the
    <i>qualifications</i>, the subscriber will be notified via the
    <code>dataUpdate</code> method.

    <p> Resources in the RSS also support a simple form of
    type-specific methods, with a sequence of strings as the
    arguments.  To <code>invoke</code> call is used for this.

    <p>In order to get data in to the RSS, there are two methods that
    push simple raw data onto a predefined DataFeed:
    <code>pushString</code> and <code>pushLong</code>, for string and
    numeric data respectively.  This is a minimal set which will
    likely be extended later.

    <p>The <code>DataSubscriber</code> interface is implemented by the
    client, and is used only for subscription callbacks.  The
    <code>Qualifier</code> interface will most likely be implemented
    as a CORBA ValueType -- supplied by the client but invoked on a
    local copy in the server. These would typically be used to
    restrict callbacks, as determined by the client.  The most common
    form of <code>Qualifier</code> would specify an epsilon below
    which changes in value are considered too small to matter.  A
    <code>Qualifier</code> might also be based on time, credibility or
    origin, or on any combination of these.

</li>


<li>
    <a name="DataModel"><b>RSS Data Models</b></a>

    <p>The abstract interfaces above completely describe the external
    view of the RSS, but the heart of the service for any particular
    domain is inside, in the form of a data model.  

    <p>The data model in an RSS is represented as a graph of nodes,
    usually but not always a tree.  The types of nodes available in
    any given RSS instance represent the abstract model of a domain,
    while the collection of related instances represents a specific
    domain. Depending on the domain, the tree might be very flat or
    might have some depth -- higher level RSS instances might contain
    representations of Components, the processes that contain them and
    the processing nodes that contain the processes.

    <p>A node in this tree of any given type can best be thought of as
    a dynamic closure over a set of fixed <i>parameters</i> that are
    sufficient to distinguish it from others of the same type.  In
    addition, types also define <i>formulas</i>, i.e., computational
    expressions evaluated dynamically on the basis of parameters and
    formulas of the other nodes (or the same node) as well as raw data
    coming in from a DataFeed.  Formulas can be trivially simple,
    amounting to little more than attributes read more or less
    directly from raw data.  The Load Average formula below is an
    example.  They can also be arbitrarily complex.  We could for
    example define formulas that compute min and max Load Averages
    over some unit of time for a single processing node, and a higher
    level formula that computes a mean over a set of these max Load
    Averages over all the processing nodes in a pool.

    <p>The formula dependency relation defines the data chaining and
    propagation within the RSS.  The tree relation, on the other hand,
    describes a form of containment: child nodes inherit the formulas
    of their ancestors (i.e., the nodes which contain them, directly
    or indirectly).  The form of this model should now make more clear
    the nature of DataAccess paths.  A path describes the location of
    some node in the tree, in form of a sequence of parameterized node
    type names, followed by the name of a parameter or formula of that
    node.
