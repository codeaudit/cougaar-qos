	* SyscondFactory.java:
	Bug #1590 -- Extensive Name Server processing load
	Diagnosis: Excessive fetching of (topology entity) attributes to
	implement Syscond topology polling. The algorithm is O(N^3) in
	number of agents (assuming a fixed Node/Agent ratio). Clearly,
	this is not scalable.
	Changed the algorithm to be O(N^2). Still not scalable, but blows
	up less rapidly. Polling is _not_ a good idea.
