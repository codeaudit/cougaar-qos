<h1>Overview</h1>

<p> Cougaar QuO module adds runtime support for
<a href="http://quo.bbn.com"> Quality Objects (QuO) </a>. QuO is used
to add Quality of Service (QoS) adaption to object oriented software,
such as Cougaars internal infrastructure. 

<p> This module adds support for the QuO kernel, which is a factory
for QuO SystemConds and Contracts. The Metrics Service also uses QuO
Resource Status Service (RSS) to implement the Metrics Service
engine. This module implements helper functions which allow easy
interfacing between the Cougaar Metrics service and the QuO
Kernel. Specifically it adds:
<ul>
  <li> Metrics SysConds get their values from the Metrics Service
  <li> A Syscond factory for creating Metrics Sysconds for different types
      of metrics and for reusing metrics. 
</ul>

<p> QuO has been used with Cougaar to make QoS adaptive MTS Aspects
for dynamically enabling compression and SSL. These MTS Aspects enable
or disable compression and SSL based on the network conditions. The
Ultralog society is the largest example of an application enhanced
with QuO. The 2004 assessment had two types of QuO Qoskets, with
1000's of Contracts and Syscond instances running on around 100 hosts.
