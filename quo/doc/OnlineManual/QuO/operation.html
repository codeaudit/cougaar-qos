<h1>Operation</h1>

<p> The QuO GUI can be enabled to view of status of QuO Sysconds,
Contracts, and Metrics. The QuO gui is a swing window so the $DISPLAY
enviroment variable must be set. The gui is enabled by loading the
org.cougaar.lib.mquo.QuoGuiComponent into the NodeAgent.

<p> Note: A QuO contract viewer servlet is available from Ultralog
Robustness UC3. This allows viewing of QuO Contracts using the Cougaar
Servlet interface.
