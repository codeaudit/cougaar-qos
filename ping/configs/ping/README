The ping/config/ping directory contains example Ping societies which 
work with cougaar script


MiniPing.xml the standard node configuration with agent mobility,
metric serivice, and system inspection servlets. To run:
  cd $CIP/ping/config/ping
  $CIP/bin/cougaar MiniPing.xml NodeA

MiniPing-minimum.xml is a full throttle single-ping with all the
survivability featurs of Cougaar disabled. This "single node"
configuration is fast and small, but one mistake and you're road
kill. To run:
  cd $CIP/ping/config/ping
  $CIP/bin/cougaar MiniPing-minimum.xml NodeA

MiniPing-2nodes.xml is the standard configurtion with the ping agents 
on two differnent nodes. This allows the society to be run one or two
hosts. To run"
  edit Miniping-2node.xml to change the name server host.
   -Dorg.cougaar.name.server=NodeA@localhost:8888</vm_parameter>
  On the nameserver host:
    cd $CIP/ping/config/ping
    $CIP/bin/cougaar MiniPing-2nodes.xml NodeA
  On the other host:
    cd $CIP/ping/config/ping
    $CIP/bin/cougaar MiniPing-2nodes.xml NodeB

MiniPing-2nodeMin.xml is the minimum configurtion with the ping agents 
on two differnent nodes. This allows the society to be run one or two hosts.
To run follow the same procedure as MiniPing-2node.xml
