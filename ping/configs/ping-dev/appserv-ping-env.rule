# tell all nodes where the XML file is located
society.each_node do |node|
  node.override_parameter("-Dorg.cougaar.society.file","Ping.xml")
end

# tell all nodes where the name server is located
#society.each_node do |node|
#  node.override_parameter("-Dorg.cougaar.name.server","HOST1:8888")
#end
