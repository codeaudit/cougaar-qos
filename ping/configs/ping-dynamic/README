Description & Operation: 
This collection of files will allow one to specify a miniping society at run-time, from one of three
standard configurations, allowing the user to also specify the number of agents/nodes in the society. 
To do this, the user must uncomment one of the ping-builder actions in the RunMiniPingActions.rb:

  #do_action "CreateOneToOnePing", 3
  #do_action "CreateSrcToMultSinkPing", 3
  #do_action "CreateMultSrcToSinkPing", 3


The configuration options are:

1. CreateOneToOnePing - Like the name insinuates, this is a pair-wise configuration, (src-to-sink), where all pingers(srcs) reside
on one node and host, and all the pingees(sinks) reside on a separate single node/host.
The argument to the action is the number of pairs of srcs&sinks. 

2. CreateSrcToMultSinkPing - Creates multiple sinks to one src in the society configuration. The src resides on one node on one host, 
while the multiple sinks reside on separate nodes on another host. The argument to the action is the number of sinks desired in configuration.

3. CreateMultSrcToSinkPing - Similar named action to create multiple srcs to one sink the society configuration. The srcs reside on distinct
nodes on one host, while the one sink resides on it's own node on a separate host. The argument to the action is the number of srcs desired 
in the configuration. 

To Run:
move RunMiniPingActions.rb from $CIP/configs/ping-dynamic/ to $CIP/csmart/scripts
cd to $CIP/csmart/scripts/
run with $ruby RunMiniPingActions.rb

Notes on configuration: 
Currently the specification of multiple hosts is not implemented.  The nameserver node is specified in a the createPingManager rule 
$PING_HOME. This is meant to create a manager node for the ping society, and assign it as the nameserver. If this rule is not applied, 
the nameserver will be assigned randomly. 

To Add Additional Configuration: 
Include your rules in the TransformSociety action, add a similar rule to add another manager node/agent, assigning any facets
or roles you wish.
