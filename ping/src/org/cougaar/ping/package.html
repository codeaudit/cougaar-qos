Simple inter-agent "ping" code, primarily intended for 
infrastructure testing of message transport and agent mobility.
<p>
This is not mobility-specific per se, but is packaged within
mobility to keep it separate from the rest of core.  The ping
APIs are primiarily intended for testing.
<p>
See later in this document for 
<a href="#tests">suggested tests</a> that use the ping
support.

<h2>Ping APIs and Plugin Usage</h2>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Ping</b>
<dd>
The interface for the ping data structure.
<p>

<dt>
<b>PingImpl</b>
<dd>
The Relay-based implementation of the "Ping".  This implementation
is package private.
<p>

<dt>
<b>PingAdderPlugin</b>
<dd>
An optional plugin that can be used to create pings at agent
startup.  Multiple PingAdderPlugins can be used in the same
agent to create complex message traffic patterns.  Each 
PingAdderPlugin instance is parameterized to define the ping.
<p> 
An example is:<pre>
  plugin = org.cougaar.core.mobility.ping.PingAdderPlugin(target=AgentX)
</pre>
which will send a ping every 2 seconds to AgentX.  See the
javadocs for additional comma-separated parameters.
<p>

<dt>
<b>PingTimerPlugin</b>
<dd>
Required plugin for the ping iterations and timeouts to work.  It
must be loaded into all agents that will create pings:<pre>
  plugin = org.cougaar.core.mobility.ping.PingTimerPlugin(wakeMillis=3000)
</pre>
where "wakeMillis" tells the plugin how often to check for ping
timeouts.  The minimum allowed value is 500 milliseconds.
<p>

<dt>
<b>PingServlet <i>("/ping")</i></b>
<dd>
An optional servlet that can be used to display pings, remove
existing pings, or add new pings.  The servlet is loaded with:
<pre>
  plugin = org.cougaar.core.mobility.ping.PingServlet
</pre>
A single plugin parameter can optionally be used to override
the default "/ping" servlet path.

<h2>Suggested Tests</h2>
<p>
First, consider turning up the ping logging level by adding this 
line to your "log.props":<pre>
  log4j.category.org.cougaar.core.mobility.ping=INFO
</pre>
<p>
Here are some suggested tests:
<ol>
<li>
Create an endless stream of pings between agent "AgentA" on node 
"NodeA" to agent "AgentB" on node "NodeB".  Examine the MTS metrics
for message-counters and bandwidth consumption.
</li><p>
<li>
Modify the PingAdderPlugin parameters to reduce the delay between
pings from the default 2 seconds down to zero seconds:<pre>
  delayMillis=0
</pre>
</li><p>
<li>
Enable the "eventMillis=5000" option in the PingAdderPlugin and
enable cougaar events in the log4j configuration:<pre>
  log4j.category.EVENT.org.cougaar.core.mobility.ping=DEBUG
</pre>
Watch the periodic cougaar events for ping round-trip-time
statistics (min/max/mean/stddev).
</li><p>
<li>
Run the above test again.  Use the "/move" servlet to move AgentA 
from NodeA to an empty node named "NodeC.  Verify that the pings 
from AgentA to AgentB resume and the servlets are accessable.
</li><p>
<li>
Run the above test agent but move the receiver, AgentB, instead of 
moving AgentA.
</li><p>
<li>
Create a ping from an AgentA on NodeA to a non-existent agent named 
"AgentC".  Move AgentA to an empty node named "NodeC".  Once moved,
launch NodeC with AgentC.  Verify that the previously unsendable 
pings from AgentA to AgentC are now sent.
</li>
</ol>
